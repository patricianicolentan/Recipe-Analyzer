# Recipe-Analyzer
This analyzes a recipe database to find ingredients often used with a user-defined ingredient, to try to simulate what an experienced chef would intuitively 'know'. For example, does olive oil go with basil? Yes, 1,154 times in 91,000+ recipes! But not as much as garlic, which was paired with olive oil 2,239 times!

Customizable options include how many recipes' ingredient lists to print out, and how many times an ingredient must be a partner to be printed out.

The current database being used is the allrecipes database, accessed through https://archive.org/details/recipes-en-201706 with credit for that going to Zachary Vance.
