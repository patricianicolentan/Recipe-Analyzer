# Recipe-Analyzer
This analyzes a recipe database to find ingredients often used with a user-defined ingredient, to try to simulate what an experienced chef would intuitively 'know'. For example, does olive oil go with basil? Yes, 1,154 times in 91,000+ recipes! But not as much as garlic, which was paired with olive oil 2,239 times!
